Suggestion; Social cognition (SC) is a fundamental human skill which enables individuals to perceive, interpret, and respond to their social environment. During social cognitive tasks, increased BOLD activation is reported in brain regions within the Default Mode Network (DMN), a key network implicated in mentalizing and theory of mind. Whether pro-social personality traits, such as Agreeableness, modulate DMN activity during social cognition remain uncharted territory). In our study, we hypothesized that individuals with higher Agreeableness scores would exhibit greater changes in activation within core DMN regions. We used the fMRI data and personality trait data X from the Human Connectome Project (n=100) acquired during a ToM task. We defined regions of interest (ROIs) using the Glasser parcellation, focusing on the Temporoparietal Junction, Medial Prefrontal Cortex, and Superior Temporal Sulcus activated during the ToM task. General Linear Model was employed to investigate the linear relationship between Agreeableness scores and BOLD activation contrasts (mental > random) at each of these DMN regions of interest. Our findings indicate that higher Agreeableness scores are significantly (or not) associated within X and X region during the ToM task (pvals =XX, effect-size=XX). These results underscore the potential role of personality traits in shaping neural responses during social cognition and may offer insights into the neural underpinnings of individual differences in social abilities.
